Achilles 1.5 Multithreaded File Search Engine
Author John Underhill (Steppenwolfe)
You can use this code in any way you like, so long as you give the proper credit to
the author (thats me!)..

If you have problems with the runnable.tlb, (not being able to add to Achilles proj), it is because lib is referenced in registry with previous location. Two choices: 1) reference old version (same file)
2) go to regedit, search for "runnable.tlb" and delete the path reference. It will be remade when you add tlb to new project..

Instructions:
1) Compile the active-x (prjEngine.vbp) control into the release folder
2) Add the refernce to the prjTestHarness project
3) Have fun
